# Apache2 configuration directives, customized by Loloy D
# The following directives are custom built by LD TechnoLogics for
# the regular use case.  Some directives may need to be edited
# for suitability to localized use cases.  For quick applicability,
# replace all "user1" instances with appropriate "username".
# Designed with the following environment:
# Linux Mint 18.3, Apache 2.4
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Issue the following console command to define apache2 webserver user passwords
#    (Note: the necessary subpaths may need to be created beforehand):
# $ sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords user1
# 2. Append the #LD custom directives to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
# 3. Restart apache2 service by issuing:
# $ service apache2 restart
# 4. Optional: copy ./root/var/www/html/* to the local /var/www/html/.
